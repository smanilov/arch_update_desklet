# Cinnamon desklet for semi-automating Arch updates.

I've been running Arch Linux for a couple of years now. This repository is a fun
project to automate to a large extent the system-update work that I perform on a
regular basis. The goal is to make it easier to perform updates with the hope
that it will lead to more regular updates of my system (at every boot?). A
secondary goal is to make it easier to track system evolution.

Insall by cloning the repository into
`~/.local/share/cinnamon/desklets/arch_update@smanilov`.
